Since im reading data straight from misys i should be able to delete all lines accessed then just add the lines after i do what i need to do.

So it will basically be this workflow:
    fetch data if needed
    parse it to get the info needed for the current bom
    see if the data matches the bom that was exported from solidworks
    if it matches nothing needs to be done
    if it doesnt i need to go to that bom in misys and make it match what is currently in the bom excel
    once that is done i can save the bom in misys and just delete all lines from the csv and add the up to date lines at the bottom

My idea is to loop through all boms in the 'BOM' folder on my work PC. Which means i should delete all file sin the folder if this program runs succesfully.

With all the things i learn from this project i should be able to apply them to my inventory.py project and speed things up exponentially.
